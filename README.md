# howcotton

Over the past couple of weeks we have learned how to use HTML and CSS to layout a webpage.  For this project I created a webpage for my brand howcotton that I just recently started.  I used a lot of flexbox to create each of my three pages.  I also have placeholder images and text to show what will be added overtime to make it perfect.

## Deployment

This was deployed using Surge.
First I got into the directory I wanted to deploy.
Then I entered the command Surge.
Then I had to log-in so I could be the only person to make changes and deploy it again.
Here is the domain for my website that was deployed.
